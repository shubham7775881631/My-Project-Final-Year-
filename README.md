Forecasting of the temperature by Using Time Series Analysis

Abstract: Prediction of future temperatures values is the main goal of time series forecasting. 
The model has been trained using past 137 years of data (1880-2017) and tested over 60 years 
to forecast maximum and minimum temperature It is the most challenging task 
to forecast temperature on monthly and seasonal time scale around the world for more than half a century. 
Here, ARIMA model (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a class of statistical models for analysing and forecasting time series data.
we build an optimal ARIMA model and extend it to Seasonal ARIMA(SARIMA) and SARIMAX models. 
Based on the inspection of the ACF, PACF autocorrelation plots, the most appropriate orders of the ARIMA models are determined and evaluated using the AIC-criterion. 
For the maximum and minimum temperatures at ARIMA model trend order = (1,1,1), and   ARIMA seasonal order = (1,1,0,12) are obtained.
we want to prove, based on the provided data, if the temperature on the earth is increasing over time or not. 
In other words, your goal is to prove whether the so called Global Warming exists or not. 
a time series analysis can help us to understand the underlying naturalistic process, the pattern of change over time, or evaluate the effects of either a planned or unplanned intervention 
It was demonstrated that obtained models are able to capture the dynamics of the time series data and to produce sensible forecasts.
